  I am interested in integrating and applying geographical information science (GIS), remote sensing (RS), digital terrain analysis (DTA) and high-performance computing (HPC) techniques to earth problems.


# Current focus
+ Data mining with RS, GIS, DTA and statistical approaches
+ Geo-computation and simulation of earth processes
+ Physically-based watershed hydrological responses
